Deadly border clashes erupt between Thailand and Cambodia after Trump’s peace deal collapses, causing dozens of casualties and displacing civilians amid soaring tensions over disputed territory.  
### 📋 Executive Summary  
A fatal armed confrontation erupted along the long-contested Thai-Cambodia border, marking a severe escalation just days after the collapse of a peace agreement brokered by former US President Donald Trump. Fighting lasted several days and resulted in dozens of casualties on both sides and significant civilian displacement in the border region. Both Thailand and Cambodia accused each other of violating the ceasefire, reigniting a decades-old territorial dispute that continues to destabilize the region. The clashes underscore deep-rooted mistrust and unresolved border demarcation issues despite prior diplomatic efforts. Local populations remain at risk as military engagements persist, with international concern growing over potential further escalation.  
### 📖 Comprehensive Summary  
The Thai-Cambodian border dispute has flared once again into deadly armed conflict following the disintegration of a peace deal mediated by Donald Trump. The clashes, which lasted multiple days, involved heavy artillery exchanges resulting in at least several dozen casualties among Thai and Cambodian forces, as well as local civilians caught in the crossfire. The fighting displaced hundreds from villages located along the disputed frontier, with Cambodian authorities initiating evacuations amid ongoing insecurity. Both governments have accused the other side of deliberately violating ceasefires, with each blaming the other for triggering the violence. The territory in question is part of a longstanding dispute dating back to colonial-era border definitions and successive sovereignty claims. The failure of the Trump-brokered peace initiative highlights the fragility of regional diplomatic agreements amid nationalist pressures and military posturing. Analysts suggest that without renewed international mediation and confidence-building measures, border tensions will continue to destabilize ASEAN regional security, threaten humanitarian conditions, and impede broader bilateral cooperation. The incident also raises questions about the role and influence of the United States in Southeast Asian conflict resolution as Trump's direct involvement has failed to produce lasting peace. Experts emphasize the urgent need for transparent dialogue, demilitarization zones, and international monitoring to prevent further casualties and restore stability.
